General Growing Self Organizing Maps.

This includes an extension to Core GSOM module with;

1. Including the AGE parameter for each of the neuron, in order to accompany the forgetting of the memory.
Further on this concept can be found on;
    Forgetting machine chapter 4/5.
    GWR Marsland et al. 2002
    Parisi et al. 2015

    Parameter: GSOMParameters.age_threshold

    TODO: Figure out age threshold automatically, using learning iterations and nrows(dataset)

2. Incorporate habituation.

    Updates were made to;
    1. habituate_neuron(self, tau)
    2. tau parameters in gsom_parameters
    3. weight update enriched with habituation
